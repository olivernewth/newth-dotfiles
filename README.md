# Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and configuration files for various tools and applications.

## Contents

- `.zshrc`: Configuration for Zsh shell
- `.gitconfig`: Git configuration
- `.hyper.js`: Configuration for Hyper terminal

## Installation

To install these dotfiles, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/olivernewth/dotfiles.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the dotfiles directory:
   ```
   cd dotfiles
   ```

3. Run the installation script:
   ```
   ./install.sh
   ```

The installation script will create symlinks for the configuration files in your home directory.

## Customization

Feel free to modify these dotfiles to suit your preferences. After making changes, you may need to restart your terminal or reload the configuration files for the changes to take effect.

## Prerequisites

The installation script can  handle the installation of prerequisites. However, if you prefer to install them manually, ensure you have the following:

- [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

These can be installed automatically by selecting the appropriate option in the installation script.
